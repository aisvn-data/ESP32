# ESP32 projects
----------------

We had several Arduino Uno projects at our school. But soon you want to add some bluetooth or WiFi functionality to your project. You need another module, library, cable and so on. Why not use the ESP32 that has all that out of the box? And much more RAM and storage for data and all kinds of projects? That's why it's here. Let's start simple.

## Blink
Unlike the Arduino the build-in LED is not connected to pin 13, but pin 2. Everything else is the same. Once it blinks you know that the module works, you can upload stuff and you have a simple output signal for further experiments.

## BT recieve (not BLE!)
Code follows.
